  - RÂ²: 0.9923

The model file (electricity_price_model.pkl) is a serialized scikit-learn Pipeline
containing a StandardScaler and RandomForestRegressor.

The model is trained on historical electricity price data from 2023,
capturing various patterns including:
  - Daily price variations (by hour)
  - Seasonal patterns
  - Weekend vs. weekday price differences
  - Holiday price adjustments
  - Temperature and load correlations

For optimal performance, input data should be in the same format as the training data:
  - hour: integer in range 0-23
  - load: float in range 10000-22000
  - temperature: float in range 2-38
  - is_weekend: boolean (0 or 1)
  - is_holiday: boolean (0 or 1)
